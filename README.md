Alarmic
=======

"Simplistic alarm clock for Windows"

Just download (if as ZIP, UNZIP), run install-alarmic.bat ( https://github.com/nirsh/Alarmic/zipball/master ).

This is an idiotically simple yet possibly very useful app for most people. Any comment is welcome. This is NOT presented as a competitor to any existing app, but as a small commandline and educational project.
