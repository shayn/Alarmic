Alarmic
=======

"Simplistic alarm clock for Windows"

Just download (if as ZIP, UNZIP), run install-alarmic.bat ( https://github.com/downloads/nirsh/Alarmic/alarmic-setup.zip ).

This is an idiotically simple yet possibly very useful app for most people. Anyone is welcome to join in creating something much better out of this humble project.
